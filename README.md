Data retention
==============

August 8, 2014

This is data retention policy applicable to newsrooms participating in our research. If you are a participating newsroom, please read through it and, if you have any questions, please email us at <contact@newslynx.org>.

#### What is the project?

NewsLynx is a research project at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism that aims to better understand how newsrooms measure the impact of their work. The primary researchers are [Michael Keller](http://mhkeller.com), [Brian Abelson](http://brianabelson.com) & [Stijn DeBrouwere](http://stdout.be).

#### What data will you collect?

For every article that your organization publishes, NewLynx will collect its publicly accessible metrics on social media sites Twitter and Facebook. It will collect this data over time in order to display a time series chart and perform analysis over time.

It will also collect and store mentions of your work across the internet as well as any events that you create and add to an article, series or organizational information.

If you choose to integrate Google Analytics into the platform, NewsLynx will store information such as pageviews over time, referral sources, time on page, trackbacks as well as other data recorded by Google Analytics to be determined in the course of research and in consultation with what partner news organization are interested in adding to the platform.

#### How long will you collect data for?

We will collect data for a maximum of six months and the start date will be discussed with each newsroom.

#### What will you do with this data?

This data will be used strictly for research purposes only. Data will be discussed in our white paper and future research presentations in aggregate or in an anonymized fashion such as, "one news site that very high pageviews also had many major impact events," unless a participating newsrooms gives prior written permission.

#### How long will you retain the data for?

Data that requires newsroom authentication (such as Google Analytics) and data that newsrooms create in the course of documenting the impact of their work will be retained for seven years following the termination of the research project for the purposes of record keeping and potential future research. When this data is not currently being used for research, it will be kept encrypted.

Publicly available data such as share counts, news mentions (things that do not require authentication) will be retained at the researchers' discretion.

#### Who will you share the data with?

We will not share the data with anyone outside of our research project except in the anonymous or aggregate fashion as described above for purposes of conveying our research and research findings.

#### Who can see my data?

Only you and the researchers can see your data unless you explicitly choose to allow other news organizations participating in NewsLynx to see more.
